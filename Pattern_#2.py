text = """On a quiet night, Sarah walked through the garden, gazing at the endless sky.
The wind felt Soft as it brushed against her face, whispering Tales of distant galaxies.
Along the path, a lantern flickered, reminding her of childhood Adventures spent wishing upon the glowing moon.
In the stillness, she realized that among all the chaos of life, there will always be a Reason to look up â€” 
a shining reminder that hope never fades."""
